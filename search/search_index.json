You may even be denied access for minutes to hours depending on demand. Signing up to $20 a month for a \"ChatGPT Plus\" account will eliminate the wait, and give immediate access to ChatGPT GPT-4 (which is currently throttled to 25 responses every 3 hours). The ChatGPT Plus subscription is separate from the OpenAI API in the next lesson. Getting access to ChatGPT Plugins requires registering for a waiting list. How does ChatGPT Work? \u00b6 Read the ChatGPT Documentation Read the ChatGPT Technical Report ChatGPT's GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-v4 models use natural language prompts to elicit contextual responses. ChatGPT can respond with either langauge (prose) or computer code. Other LLM models (like DALL-E or MidJourney ) produce images based on prompts. ChatGPT uses a syntax called MarkDown . Markdown is plain text that uses special characters for formatting. This website, for example, is written using MarkDown syntax ( MkDocs-Material ) and converted to HTML using Python. Language Model Family Tree Image Credit: Yang et al. examine the history of LLMs Prompt Writing \u00b6 ChatGPT asks for a message to begin its conversation. These messages are called \"Prompts\". Begin a conversation with a specific type of prompt. This will help narrow the potential range of responses and improve results to subsequent prompts. Priming \u00b6 ChatGPT does better when it is provided \"prompt primers\". Zero-shot unconditioned prompts are likely to return the least specific responses. Responses are more likely to be useful when multiple specific output types are defined. Types of Priming Example Zero (Shot) \"Write five examples of assessments for watershed health.\" Single \"Write five examples of assessments for watershed health. Here is one example: Geomorphology\" Multiple \"Write five examples of assessments for watershed health related to geomorphology, water quality, and species diversity.\" Prompt Structure \u00b6 Role Task Format Act as [ROLE] Create a [TASK] ... show as [FORMAT] Your prompt should specify the role in which ChatGPT responds, what its task is, and the format of how its outputs should be returned. A second step to the initial prompt is to link or chain your subsequent prompts. This lesson only covers ChatGPT, but the same prompt techniques can be used in other LLMs. ChatGPT Awesome Lists There is an ever changing meta-list of Awesome lists curated around ChatGPT plugins and extensions. search: chatgpt+awesome Check out lists around: ChatGPT Prompts ChatGPT Data Science Prompts API plugins, extensions, & applications Role \u00b6 Set the role for ChatGPT to play during your session. \"I want you to act as ...\" will establish what type of conversation you are planning to have. Types of Role Project Manager Copywriter / Editor Paper Reviewer Teacher / Mentor / Advisor Student / Learner / Participant Software Engineer DevOps Engineer Linux Terminal Python Interpreter Web Browser Examples of roles you might ask for are: a domain science expert, an IT or DevOps engineer, software programmer, journal editor, paper reviewer, mentor, teacher, or student. You can even instruct ChatGPT to respond as though it were a Linux terminal , a web browser, a search engine, or language interpreter. Data Scientist Let's try an example prompt with role-playing to help write code in the R programming language. I want you to act as a data scientist with complete knowledge of the R language, the TidyVerse, and RStudio. Write the code required to create a new R project environment, Download and load the Palmer Penguins dataset, and plot regressions of body mass, bill length, and width for the species of Penguins in the dataset. Your response output should be in R and RMarkDown format with text and code delineated with ``` blocks. At the beginning of new file make sure to install any RStudio system dependencies and R libraries that Palmer Penguins requires. Example can use GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4 Tasks \u00b6 Prompts which return informative responses to questions like \"What is ...\" or \"How does ...\" Because of ChatGPT's proclivity at making up information, using it without a way of validating the authenticity of its responses makes it less trustworthy than regular search engines. Types of Task Scientific Article Essay Blog Post Outline Email Cover Letter Recipe Tutorial Lesson Plan Jupyter Notebook Configuration Code Software Script Bing and Bard fill an important space in these types of prompts - they return websites which match the query criterion and allow you to research your own answers. There are extension tools for ChatGPT which allows you to prompt with references. Access to the Internet By default, ChatGPT does not have access to the Internet, and is limited to the time period before September 2021 (as of mid-2023) for its training data time frame. There are extension tools, like WebChatGPT which you can install in your browser (Firefox or Chrome), that will extend ChatGPT's reach to the internet. What you're actually doing with this extension is automating the creation of a much larger promt message, which includes hyperlinks to resources on the internet. Format \u00b6 By default ChatGPT outputs MarkDown syntax text. It can also output software code, and soon images, video, music and sounds. Formats to output MarkDown Text (\\& emojis) List Table HTML CSS Regular Expression CSV / TXT JSON Rich Text Gantt Chart Word Cloud Graphs Spreadsheets You can also ask ChatGPT to explain complex topics or to act as a cook-book step-by-step guide. ChatGPT can provide instructional details about how to do specific tasks. Documentation Writer I want you to act as a DIY expert. You will help me develop the skills necessary to complete simple lab documentation, create tutorials and guides for beginners and experts, and explain complex concepts in layman's terms using visual techniques, and develop helpful resources. I want you to create a tutorial for building and deploying a github.io website using the MkDocs Material Theme Linked Prompts \u00b6 Follow-up your prompts sequentially. Responses to prompts may not return the exact details or information that you are after the first time. Follow-up by rephrasing your prompts more carefully and continuing with iterative prompting can build upon your priors. \"Chain prompting\" or \"Linked Prompting\" brings multiple prompts together. Linked Prompting Examples Step 1: Priming \"I want you to act as an eminent hydrologist from CUASHI. Provide me with a list of the ten most important topics in hydrology over the last decade focused around research in the global south, working with indigenous communities, and traditional ecological knowledge systems.\" Step 2: Summarizing \"Based on the list you just created, summarize the most pressing financial challenges faced by indigenous communities in the Global South, versus indigenous communities in North America, in less than 50 words.\" Step 3: Try again with enabled WebChatGPT or Browsing \"Based on the results of web access, can you confirm the validity of the ten important topics and provide at least one reference to each.\" Code-Interpreter \u00b6 ChatGPT's Code-interpreter plugins are still in Alpha and Beta release, however they show great promise for helping to anlayze data graphically and statistically. General Prompt Traits \u00b6 Strategies Keep these W's in mind when writing prompts W's Reasons Who do you want ChatGPT to role-play: an engineer, an editor, a teacher, or a student? What is the specific context of your prompts? When is the specific time period of interest? Specify if so. Where is the geographic region or conceptual area? In what way do you want ChatGPT to respond: in a programming language, code, text-to-image? Syntax Use MarkDown syntax in your prompts. For code examples use single backtick ` or triple ``` for block quotes when adding your own code to your prompts. Context Develop a clear context around which you are seeking responses. Types of prompt help to establish the context of the responses you will recieve. Precision Keep your prompts precise and use clear language. Constrain the topic areas for which you wish your repsonses to be drawn from. Simplicity Break down your prompts into simple tasks which do not contain too many complex tasks or ones that require rationalization. Software Development \u00b6 ChatGPT is trained on langauges, including software language. Use ChatGPT as your new paired-programming AI assistant. Go to our lesson on GitHub CoPilot For novice programmers, ChatGPT likely fills a long unfilled hole in your knowledge map. It can write code faster than you can, and with the proper prompts, create programs in minutes which may have taken you hours or days. Linux Guru ChatGPT is trained on common data science languages, like Python, Julia, and R. Use ChatGPT to help develop basic code or to explain and debug code you're trying to write. Using ChatGPT can be a time savings, reducing the time it takes to look for the answers yourself over conventional search. I want you to act as a humble data scientist who works a lot with Python and scientific visualization Create a Python script which generates a visually pleasing and compelling heat map for a CSV dataset You can also use it to summarize code or to help explain its operation I want you to act as a humble data scientist who works a lot with Linux Explain to me what the following code does: $ find /home/www \\( -type d -name .git -prune \\) -o -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/subdomainA\\.example\\.com/subdomainB.example.com/g' Other valuable uses: Change variable names and file names! When you have a large dataset with many files and folder names, you can ask ChatGPT to help design a schema for renaming your project's content Regular Expressions, or regex is a bane of many programmers. ChatGPT can write, edit, and explain complex regex I want you to act as a regex generator. Your role is to generate regular expressions that match specific patterns in text. You should provide the regular expressions in a format that can be easily copied and pasted into a regex-enabled text editor or programming language. Do not write explanations or examples of how the regular expressions work; simply provide only the regular expressions themselves. remove any numbers from a string and replace them with a capital X For more advanced programmers, ChatGPT's weaknesses may become apparent when optimizing or linting complex code bases. However, there are already extension tools which can evaluate code performance and make changes or suggestions. DevOps Engineer ChatGPT can automate tasks and write tests I want you to act as a DevOps engineer who specializes in SQL and Docker. I am running an Ubuntu 22.04 server with a dockerized web service which appears to have a memory leak. Write a unit test for the PostgreSQL web server using SQL, JSON, or Python that can find the process which is causing the leak and restart the docker-compose service. You can also use ChatGPT to help optimize your code's performance. Make this code run faster and use less memory using BASH ``` import os # folder path dir_path = os.getcwd() # list to store files res = [] # Iterate directory for path in os.listdir(dir_path): # check if current path is a file if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir_path, path)): res.append(path) print(res) ``` Word Processing \u00b6 Outlining ChatGPT can help to create outlines for any type of writing. This can help get beyond a blank page problem. Getting ideas on paper Create a basic outline about an idea that you want to work on Create a title and sections for a student data challenge with three sections and no more than three subsections each. The challenge should be about using Earth Observation System data from NASA and European Space Agency to diagnose environmental change and human societies. Editing Proof-reading, removing passive voice, rewording for clarity and readability are all potential features that can be prompted from ChatGPT. When establishing the role of the responses, consider Summarizing When small or large groups are working together to synthesize discussions around scientific research, they often maintain the discussion topics in large sets of notes with many contributions. Use ChatGPT to summaries a day or a week's worth of notes. Include the schedule or agenda and ask ChatGPT to summarize whether the agenda met the topics of interest, or even suggest directions which went unexplored. Translation ChatGPT can be used for translating languages, and for specifying regional dialect translation. Althought it was not specifically designed for language translation, it does a relatively good job at most major languages to English. For English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers, ChatGPT utility in writing more formal or professional text is likely of high value. Writing While it is unethical to allow ChatGPT to write original research on your behalf, you can use it to help write technical documentation, recipes, or how-to-lists for yourself or a lab group. You can use also ChatGPT to draft email responses or to write letters, although doing so autonomously is unprofessional and potentially unethical conduct. ChatGPT timing out without completing its responses? When generating a long set of results, ChatGPT may time out after 60 seconds. You can resume the output of the prompt by telling it to 'continue'. For text: continue or for code response: continue ``` Academic Research \u00b6 ChatGPT is not (yet) reliable at producing factual responses and should not be used as a replacement for conventional research techniques such as literature reviews.

When you have a large dataset with many files and folder names, you can ask ChatGPT to help design a schema for renaming your project's content Regular Expressions, or regex is a bane of many programmers. ChatGPT can write, edit, and explain complex regex I want you to act as a regex generator. Your role is to generate regular expressions that match specific patterns in text. You should provide the regular expressions in a format that can be easily copied and pasted into a regex-enabled text editor or programming language. Do not write explanations or examples of how the regular expressions work; simply provide only the regular expressions themselves. remove any numbers from a string and replace them with a capital X For more advanced programmers, ChatGPT's weaknesses may become apparent when optimizing or linting complex code bases.
